# RocDSL Python package runtime dependencies.
#
# Notes:
# - Build-time deps (pybind11/nanobind/numpy for native extensions) are declared in
#   `pyproject.toml` under `[build-system].requires`.
# - GPU execution tests/benchmarks require a working ROCm + PyTorch install, but we
#   intentionally do not hard-require `torch` here for pure codegen / IR workflows.
